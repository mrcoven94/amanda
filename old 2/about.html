							<h1>About Me</h1>
                            <hr>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/about-me.png" alt="" /></span>My motivation for studying computer science and electrical engineering started as a dancer at Pacific Northwest Ballet. One day, a muscle tore in my calf and I fell to the ground. For two weeks, I was bed-ridden in recovery. During recovery, I spent my days watching YouTube videos about robotics. I was so intrigued by the videos that I began doing research on futuristic applications for robotics. I explored humanoid robots, robots for domestic use, and robots for therapy use. One day, I encountered an article from the University of Washington about robotic muscles. This article resonated with me. What if an artificial calf muscle was developed that would allow my calf to operate normally again? This discovery intrigued me and I began to think about ways that robotics could save people from situations similar to mine. Next, I began thinking of the impact robotics could have on society. Amputees could be able to walk again or be able to pick up objects with robotic limbs. A robot could assist the elderly with household chores when they lose the ability to do those chores themselves. Excited by these possibilities, I declined a dance contract and came to study robotics at the University of Washington. </p>
                        
							<p>As a ballerina, who did not come from a math/science background, I found basic CS and EE concepts difficult. I struggled with coding at first and found the syntax and structures foreign. However, after I got over the hurdle of becoming comfortable with code, I was able to get creative with my projects. In the three years I have been in the engineering discipline I have worked on a pneumatic hand, an autonomous robotic tank, a chess bot, and currently work on autopilot route prediction. 
                </p>
                        
                        <p>What I really love about robotics is how I can build things that are inspired by my background that can make an impact on the world around me. My goal is to build the hardware and software for a full scale robot that can help my parents when they become older and to help out other ballerinas out there who may face injuries and physical boundaries.</p>
